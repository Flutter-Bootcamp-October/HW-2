## Description:

we create functional and user-friendly Weather app using Flutter. The app should display weather information based on the user's searching . Users should be able to view the current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy). All weather data should be fetched from a reliable weather API and displayed in a user-friendly manner.
